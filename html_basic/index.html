    <!-- Paragraphs -->
    <p>
      This is my very first webpage, and I’m excited to share it with you. It’s
      a simple design, but it’s 100% valid HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve included different heading levels, some paragraphs, and even a
      clickable image to make it interactive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of this page is to practice HTML basics, including structure,
      links, and accessibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay tuned — this is just the beginning of my journey into web
      development!
